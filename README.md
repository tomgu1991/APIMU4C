# Dataset of empirical study on API-Misuse Bugs in Open-Source C Programs
- API-misuse-patches: patches of API-misuse-fix related commits to summarize root causes of API-misuse bugs in C Projects
- benchmark: a API-misuse benchmark of C code to evaluate existing static detectors
- Gitgrabber: to help readers extract the commits message, changed files and patch files, we open source our **Gitgrabber** tool. 

We upload all the original data and evaluation results.
